a double linked list version 1.

Main purpose is to show the advantage of using double linked list.

Two observations:

o   We also see we have a single pointer (head_element) which points to
    the head of the list.  We obtain the end of the list via:
    head_element->left.  We need to use the if do while to iterate across
    the list.

  
o   We also need to test for head_element == 0 numerous times.
