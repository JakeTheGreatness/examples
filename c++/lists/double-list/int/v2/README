a double linked list version 2.

Main purpose is to show the advantage of using double linked list
which now has a sentinal element to avoid the frequent test whether
head_element == 0.  This costs a little extra memory but makes the
code simpler and faster.

Observation:

o   We still have a single pointer (head_element) which points to
    the head of the list.  We obtain the end of the list via:
    head_element->left.  We need to use the if do while to iterate across
    the list.
